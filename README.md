# Streamer Analytics

Maintain a list of streamers and see some interesting stats about them

## TODO

### Backend

- Handle twitch API authentication
- Delve into the streamers' stats (I've got a general idea of what I want to display)

### Frontend

Everything needs to be done in the frontend, I only have a very general idea of how I want it to look like in the end.

## Requirements

Java 17 and Maven (3.8.2)

## Goal

The main goal of this project is to learn Spring.
